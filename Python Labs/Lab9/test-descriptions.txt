Test 1 description -
Two colors YELLOW and WHITE paints equal number of cows.
There is a cycle between four colors - BLUE, ORANGE, PURPLE
BLUE triggers ORANGE, ORANGE triggers PURPLE, PURPLE triggers both ORANGE and BLUE.
This will test whether visited nodes are marked properly and does end in infinite loop.
Float co-ordinates are present to make sure they are working as expected.

Test 2 description -
None of the cows are within radius distance of any paintball.
But there are paint-balls within range of other paint-balls.
The paint-ball should be triggered by the other paint-balls but output should indicate that none of the cows are painted.
Also there are two paint-balls within radius of each other. The run should not get in the circular loop and simulation needs to end.

Test 3 description -

There are some cows which are not within radius of any paintball other than the giant paintball at the center.
There are some paint-balls which does not trigger any other paint-balls and does not paint any cows.
There's one giant paint ball which paint all the cows and triggers all the paint-balls.
This tests that graph works together well with all the border cases in the same run.
One of the cow(PENNY) which is diagonal distance from paintball(WHITE) which tests the distance formula.
Float co-ordinates are present to make sure they are working as expected.
